This was our projects for Dart Hackathon 2012.

Our first idea was to create a globe using the Three Dart (a dart port of the Three.js https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js)
but the sphere class wasn't ported yet so we tried to port the javascript one. Since we weren't used to work with
dart we had a lot o trouble trying to setup everything and at the end of the first day we managed to create a sphere 
(it's on the dir darThreeD/main/display/Sphere.dart) but there was still a lot of stuff that needed to be done. 
On the second and last day one of the members of our team couldn't show up so we decided to make a simpler project, the idea 
was to create a mashup using the google maps and instagram APIs, where the user could search for a tag and see the locations 
where the photos using tag were taken, so if you search for "Cat", for example, it'll show you the most recent places where 
people took photos of cats.

We've learned some cool stuff trying to make these projects, and even though the language still in its early years 
we could see that it have a lot of potential to become a great alternative to javascript.

You can see the project working (with the dart code converted to js using the dart editor) in this link:
